Homework Instructions: (asterix * means optional, might be not too obvious)
Objective:
Extend the existing Animal project by creating new classes, adding custom methods, and covering the new objects and methods with unit tests. (*)Additionally, write unit tests to cover the main app functionality.
Tasks:
Create new classes:
Create at least two new classes that inherit from the Animal class.
Give each class a unique name and provide a relevant implementation for the Speak method.
Add custom methods:
Add at least one custom method to each of the new classes you created.
Ensure that the methods are meaningful and relevant to the class's behavior.
Write unit tests for the new classes and methods:
Create a new test class or extend the existing AnimalTests class.
Write tests to validate the behavior of your new classes and their custom methods. - most important part
Make sure your tests cover different scenarios and edge cases.
* Cover the main app functionality with unit tests:
Refactor the main app functionality into a separate class (e.g., AnimalController or AnimalManager).
This class should include methods for adding animals, removing animals, and performing operations on the animals (e.g., making them speak).
Write unit tests for the methods in the new class, ensuring that the main app functionality is covered.
